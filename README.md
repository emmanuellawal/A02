What is Github? 
GitHub is a source control platform for users to publish files of code that can be interacted with anyone regardless of location. Developers who create apps or any online entity can post their codes and can continue to adjust and contribute to push new versions of code. This website allows for users to easily collaborate on work regardless of location and can update every user of the most recent revisions.

Here are the steps to using GitHub as a beginner:
1. Open GitHub.com or the desktop app (the best version)
2. If not done already, click SIGN UP to create an account
3. You will then be brought to your personalized home page where on the left side of the scree, you will click on a green button labeled NEW next to the term REPOSITORY
4. You will then give your REPOSITORY a name, put a small description of what this project will be about, and the most important part is to initialize a READ.ME file before creating
5. Once the previous step is completed, you can open up this REPOSITORY and will see all the information related. You will click on another green button on the right center side of the screen labeled CLONE or DOWNLOAD which will alow you to have every file within this REPOSITORY on your desktop locally. You can leave it at the default location or you can set its destination to any location you see fit.
6. For any files that are associated with the REPOSITORY, if you edit these files in Visual Studio, you can "commit to master" these changes either on VS or on the GitHub desktop app.
7. You will then be prompted to push commits to origin and click PUSH ORIGIN where your repository will then be updated to the latest version
